# Easy GarrysMod Asset Decoupler (EGAD)
A program for adding, removing, or extracting files from a Garry's Mod BSP File utilising Windows Explorer.

## How does it work?
It works by extracting the files of the BSP to a folder, allowing you to add files to the folder,
then add the folder back into the BSP. This allows you to add files to the BSP like adding
files to a folder in Windows, like how Windows allows you to add or remove files from a .zip
file using Windows Explorer.

## Compatability
At the moment, Garry's Mod is the only engine branch to be tested with this program. Other engine
branches like Left 4 Dead or Team Fortress 2 may not work properly with this program. Future
intergration into these engine branches is being considered

## Used Libraries
If you download the Source Code, you'll need to go to the NuGet Package Manager and install these
two used Libraries.

## Why is the logo the E.Gadd symbol?
Because the name is similiar to the program's name.
